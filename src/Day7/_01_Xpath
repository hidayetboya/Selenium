XPATH

Pros
-> can search both forward and backward (CSS Selector can only search forward)
-> can search with displayed text
-> can locate by index

Cons
-> works slower than the other methods

/html/body/div/h1  -> Absolute XPATH

tagName[attribute='value']  -> CSS selector

//tagName[@attribute='value'] -> XPATH (Relative XPATH)

//h1[text()='Survey Demo']  -> element with a displayed name "Survey Demo"

//input[starts-with(@id,'syx_e')] -> element that has an id starts with "syx_e"

//input[contains(@id,'tzn')] -> element that has an id contains "tzn"

//div[contains(text(),'how you use XYZ')] -> element that has a visible text and contains "how you use XYZ"

tagName[attribute='value'][attribute='value'] -> CSS selector

//input[@type='hidden' and @name='syx_tzn'] -> element that has both of these attributes
//input[@type='hidden' or @name='syx_tzn'] -> element that has either type or name attribute

tagName[attribute='value']>  -> CSS child

//div[@id='user-name']/input[@type='text'] -> searches for input among the immediate children
//div[@id='user-name']//input[@type='text'] -> searches for input among the entire family (children and grand Children)

//ul[@class='nav navbar-nav']//li/following-sibling::li[@class='dropdown'] -> first sibling of the first li element

//ul[@class='nav navbar-nav']//li/following::li[@class='dropdown'] -> li elements among all siblings after the first child

//button[text()='Show Message']/..                          -> parent of button element
//button[text()='Show Message']/parent::form                -> works as the previous one
//button[text()='Show Message']/../..                       -> grand parent of button element
//button[text()='Show Message']/parent::form/parent::div    -> works as the previous one

(//button[@class='btn btn-primary'])[2]     -> gives the second of button elements with the same locator
